# Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the elements in the list.

# Example:

# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: 15

num=[2,3,1,4,5,5]
strr=sum(num)
print(strr)

'''Question 2:
Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only
the even numbers from the original list.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [2, 4, 6]'''

str_input = [3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 6, 8, 7, 9]
even_numbers = [num for num in str_input if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
